We will make the following assumptions about the processes, sometimes called jobs, that are running in the system:
1. Each job runs for the same amount of time.
2. All jobs arrive at the same time.
3. Once started, each job runs to completion.
4. All jobs only use the CPU (i.e., they perform no I/O) 
5. The run-time of each job is known.

No notes here, it was just basic FIFO, shortest time first and shortest compute time first.
