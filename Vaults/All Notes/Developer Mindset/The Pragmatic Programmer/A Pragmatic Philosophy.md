- It's often the accumulation of small things that breaks morale and teams.
- Remember the Big Picture.
- *Get in the habit of rally looking and noticing your surroundings. Then do the same for your project.*
- The scope and quality of the system you produce should be discussed as a part of the system's requirements.
	- Make Quality a Requirements Issue
- [[#Building Your Portfolio]]: Invest Regularly in Your Knowledge Portfolio.
- Critically Analyse What You Hear And Read.
- Ask yourself: "Is this a good time to talk about ...?"
- Build Documentation In, Don't Bolt It On.

### Building Your Portfolio
1. *Invest Regularly:* Even in small amounts invest in learning regularly, habit is as important as the sums, consistent time and place are the key.
2. *Diversify:* The more different things you know the more valuable you are, it doesn't by any means mean you don't master the tech you are currently working in. It means that expand your horizons, explore outside of what you are working in right now.
3. *Manage risk:* It's not a good idea to go after the shiny new tech coming out every day, they risk collapse leaving you with all the knowledge about *relics of the past.*
4. *Buy Low, Sell High:* A bit of anathema to the 3rd point. Investing in an up and coming tech that seems to have potential is a good thing, but in moderation. Learn it but not at the cost of everything else. 
5. *Review and Rebalance:* The hot tech you started earlier has cooled down, the one concept you brushed off as irrelevant before has now become a thing? Adapt, the industry is ever changing and adapting to it will take you further than you might think.

Other things you can do:
- Maybe try to learn a new language every year. Different languages cater to different problems and learning them would broaden your horizons.
- Read a Technical book each month.
- Read nontechnical books too.
- Take classes.
- Participate in local user groups and meetups.
- Experiment with different environments.
- Stay current: Read news about other technologies and their trends.

### Critical Thinking
1. *Ask the "Five Whys":* Ask why at least five times. Ask a question and get an answer and they ask again to dig deeper into it.
2. *Who does this benefit:* Seems cynical but knowing whose pockets are being lined is a good thing to know.
3. *What's the Context:* Say you are reading the best practices or patterns, now ask 
	- Who is this best for?
	- Under what conditions is this the best?
	- What are the short and long term implications.
1. *When or Where does this Work:* Under what circumstance? Was it too early? Don't stop at reading what was given, ask yourself `What after that?.`
2. *Why is this a problem:* Is there an underlying model? What are its assumptions? What are its cons?
