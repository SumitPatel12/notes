### TLDR
- Do What Works not whats Fashionable.
- Deliver when users need it.
- Use Version Control to drive build, tests and automation.
- Test Early, Test Often, Test Automatically.
- Coding is not done till the tests are passing.
- *Test State Coverage, Not Code Coverage.*
- Find bugs once, add tests and make sure to find and address the root cause not the symptom.
- Wherever possible automate the process.
- Great question to ask about success and clarification:
	- `How will you know that we've all benn successful (some amount of time; month, year, week?) after the project/features completion?`
- The software is only a means to the end.
- The essence of being a programmer is to be a **Problem Solver.**
