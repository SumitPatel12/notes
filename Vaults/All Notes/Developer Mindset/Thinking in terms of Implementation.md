______

- Think about all possible solutions and pick the one where you think the trade-off is worth it for you. NOT THE ONE WHICH EVERYONE IS USING.
- Whenever faced with a concept or problem hash out how you'd go ahead implementing it. More often than not the solution is simpler than you'd imagine.
- When thinking of the solution of things we tend to go in one direction and forget the other one. For each solution try thinking of the polar opposite solution.
- Practical knowledge along with theoretical knowledge.
