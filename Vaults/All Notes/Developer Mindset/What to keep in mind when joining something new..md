### Key Takeaways
- When you join something new don't be too afraid to make big changes.
- Ask yourself why is this complex.
- Try to solve bugs one layer deep, don't just fix the problem think why it occurred in the first place.
- Have some functions in place that help you get a specific state/ mutate the states.
- Ask questions, they might be dumb, but they help you learn more than doing everything by yourself.

### When You Join a New Project
We've all felt that when starting a new project "do not make big changes", sometimes those big changes make the difference. Even if you don't fix them _call them out_, otherwise as you go those things take a back seat.

>If you are shooting yourself in the foot too, often fix the gun.

The above quote is really powerful in the sense that we accept some things as common occurrences in the process, more often than not they can be fixed with some though put behind it. **Put in that THOUGHT** It is always worth the effort.

#### Try and read PRs
As a codebase grows big it is likely to be unintelligible at the first glance. Looking at _open and closed PRs_ gives you an insight into what is being developed currently. It is a gateway into the coding style and practices, the comments on those PRs will tach you more than reading the file by yourself.


#### Learn your tools.
Whatever it may be taking the time to learn your tool is always worth it. It makes you faster in the long run.
Tools include but are not limited to:
- The technology you are using, being familiar with the language you are using is a must.
- OS
- Editor/IDE
- Typing

#### Incidental Complexity
There are times when we pass something off as *"It's complex"* but never bother explaining why it is complex.
Incidental complexity is when you can't explain why it is complex. If you can't explain exactly why it is complex, its likely that you've not thought it through or your understanding isn't complete. It's always worth addressing incidental complexity.

Try to simplify things to an overview level and work downwards. Unravel and address concerns as they come by, don't just assume that it's an issue.
**Ask yourself these questions instead of just passing it off as hard.**
- Can you break it down to "It's just doing X and Y then Z ...".
- Can you think of a previous issue with the same pattern.
